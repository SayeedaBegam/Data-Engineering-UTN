    "In this exercise, we will get to know and work with some industry-standard data processing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop a small application on top of the NYTD data set. This includes:\n",
    " - Training an ML model based on location, time and weather data to predict how many taxis will be at a certain location in New York\n",
    " - Searching for specific landmarks in New York with ElasticSearch\n",
    " - Retrieving the coordinates of the landmarks and converting them to the area identifiers used in the NYTD data set\n",
    " - Taking the weather forecast into account and predicting how many taxis will be in a certain area\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use a bunch of data processing systems. This includes a classical database with a GEO(graphy)-extension loaded (often referred to as GIS: Geographic Information System), and a full-text-search service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at full-text-search first:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is kind of similar to the Google web search: you can search for certain terms in a huge text corpus. This is done by indexing the whole corpus and matching search terms against it. Fancy operations might be supported like with fuzzy matching (ignores small typos or other differences), natural language matching (normalizes text and potentially replaces terms with semantically equivalent words) and other cool stuff! Sometimes, even regex or custom tokenizers are supported. Custom tokenizers can be useful for e.g. IP-addresses as they can appear in different forms that are all semantically equivalent. A popular service for full-text-search is ElasticSearch, which is open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a few words about GIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling geography in databases is difficult, but solves some very important use cases. Therefore, many databases either support geography out-of-the-box or via extensions. Postgres supports it via the PostGIS extension. Let's have a look at why this is difficult:\n",
    " - Latitude and longitude are special numbers that are bound between -180/180 and -90/90 and they wrap around.\n",
    " - When describing areas, there is not one standardized way, but multiple, e.g., WKB (well-known binary), human-readable text-representations (WKT: well-known text) with LINESTRINGs, POLYGONs, MULTIPOLYGONs, GeoJSON and so on...\n",
    " - Expressions are usually hard to write with SQL, e.g. \"Is the following polygon fully contained inside another polygon?\" or \"What is the distance (including the earth's curvature between the two points?\". Therefore, GIS extensions usually provide custom functions for these use cases.\n",
    " - It's not always clear, what the reference system is: The earth is not a perfect sphere, so people came up with differt, highly precise reference systems. And there are thousands of standardized reference systems, see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system. For example, there might be one that is mapped solely over Nuremberg!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, it's not trivial. Therefore, we will work with it.\n"

    "## Task 1: ElasticSearch / OpenSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part, we want to index a data set that contains landmark information about New York with ElasticSearch. We have already prepared the data set for you and brought it into a nice JSON format. However, it should be noted that the OCR from the PDF files was not perfect, and therefore there are many typos in the description. But as we've learned earlier, ElasticSearch (ES) should be able to deal with that!\n",

    "- How to use ES\n",
    "- How to index data with ES\n",

    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    " 1. Download the data set containing landmark information from the course website.\n",
    " 2. Connect to our instance of ElasticSearch.\n",
    " 3. Create an index. Include your name in the index identifier to not cause collisions.\n",
    " 4. Upload the landmark data set to your index.\n",
    " 5. Create a function that accepts a list of keywords, searches for the keywords in `title` and `description`, and returns the name and area of the results.\n",
    " 6. Run test queries against the indexed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Test queries:\n",
    " - Search for company buildings in the neo-classical architectural style (hint: we are looking for a bank)\n",

    "Let's try to predict how many taxis we will have on a certain date for a location id given the weather forecast. For the weather forecast, we have uploaded some simplified and aggregated data into the postgres instance that we also used for the location mapping. You can find the data in the `daily_weather` table inside the `public` schema of the `nytd` database. Further, we have uploaded an aggregated version of New York taxi data set into the `Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data_2021_daily_rides` table in the same schema. The model doesn't need to be perfect.\n",
